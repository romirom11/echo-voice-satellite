# Configuration Guide

Every setting, what it actually does, and when you'd touch it — in plain
language.

## Where settings live

- **Fleet config** (gear icon → Fleet Config): the defaults every device
  uses.
- **Per-device config** (device page → Config tab): each section carries its
  own **Fleet / Device** switch in its header.
- **Gemini STT (HACS)** — HA → Settings → Devices & Services → EchoMuse → **Configure** (options flow, not Fleet/Device): `Gemini API key`, `Transcription mode`, `Custom vocabulary`, `Language codes`. These are *per HA config entry*, not per device, and read fresh per turn — see **Speech-to-text (Gemini)** below. Pick the pipeline’s STT engine there too (STT dropdown → `Gemini Transcribe`).

Scoping is **per section**, not all-or-nothing. Leave a section on *Fleet*
and it keeps following the fleet-wide value, including future changes. Flip
it to *Device* and only that section becomes this device's own — everything
else carries on tracking the fleet.

So a Dot in a small room can have its own **Ring** scene and its own
**Microphones** gain while still picking up every fleet change to the wake
word, EQ and Bluetooth settings. Before this, one override forked *all* the
settings and froze them against fleet changes permanently.

A section showing *Fleet* is displayed read-only rather than hidden, so you
can always see what it is inheriting. The banner at the top of the tab
summarises — `Fleet`, or `Local override (2 of 6)` with the sections named —
and **Revert all to fleet** puts everything back.

Flipping a section back to *Fleet* **discards** the values it was holding.
There is no hidden shadow copy waiting to reappear if you flip it to *Device*
again months later; it starts from the fleet value.

Changes apply **immediately** — no restarts, no rebuilds. The Config tab
opens with the device's **network (WiFi)** settings at the top — always
per-device, never inherited from the fleet — followed by the
fleet-inheritable sections, in order of how often you'll realistically touch
them: **Playback**, **Wake word**, **Microphones**, **Ring**, **Advanced**,
**Bluetooth**.

The **CPU** meter shows the core count beside the percentage — "27% · 2/4
cores". The Dot has four CPU cores and parks the ones it isn't using, and the
percentage is a share of the cores that are *awake*, so the same amount of
work reads as a bigger number when fewer are. Without the core count beside
it the figure can appear to halve when nothing actually changed.

Two other device tabs worth knowing: **Status** (IP, firmware, WiFi network,
current volume, whether the config is fleet or overridden,
resource meters including **Latency** (the round trip to the device — amber
past 200ms, red past 1s; the only link-health signal the Echo's WiFi driver
actually provides, since it reports no retry or noise figures) and **Temp**
(the Dot's CPU sensor, and the hottest of its eleven sensors when that's
meaningfully warmer; it idles around 33°C, so anything amber is genuinely
unusual — and if the chip's thermal governor ever starts capping CPU
capacity, this is where it says so), and the
Bluetooth-proxy diagnostics panel when enabled —
the Status row reads `Online`, or `Offline` with how long ago the device was
last heard from) and **Activity** (voice-turn history — what was heard, how it was
transcribed, wake-word scores, playback underruns, near-misses, and — if
**Save utterances** is on — the recorded audio of each turn, playable and
downloadable). Activity
history is stored in the controller's database, so it survives controller
and device restarts; hourly hardware trends (CPU, memory, WiFi signal) are
kept for 180 days and available via the API
(`/api/devices/{id}/activity?days=N`).

## 01 — Playback

How responses sound.

**Two things to know before you tune anything here.**

**Changes take about four seconds to be heard.** Audio is sent to the device
several seconds ahead of when you hear it, so what is playing right now was
processed before you moved the control. Wait five seconds before judging, and
do not flip a setting back and forth quickly — you will be listening to the
old audio and conclude nothing happened.

**Change the settings on the device you are listening to.** If a device has
its own Playback settings (the Fleet/Device switch on that section), editing
the fleet defaults will not affect it. The save succeeds either way, so the
symptom is a control that appears to do nothing at all.

### Equalizer (8 faders + presets)
Shapes the tone of the voice responses, like the EQ on a stereo. The Dot's
little speaker is boomy and dull by default.

- **Flat** — no shaping.
- **Clarity** — boosts the upper-mid frequencies where speech intelligibility
  lives. Good default for voice.
- **Warmth** — gentle low-mid lift, softer top. Nicer for music-ish content.
- Drag any fader for a custom curve.

### Speech boost
An extra presence bump for spoken responses. Try it if responses sound
muffled from across the room.

### Fixed speaker protection
The output path applies its protection and level handling internally. The
subsonic filter, bass shaping, limiter behavior, and output ceiling are fixed
parts of that path, not user settings or API controls. There is no separate
speaker-protection switch to enable or tune.

Use the EQ presets and faders above for supported tone changes. If a response
sounds too loud or too quiet, use the device volume or Home Assistant's volume
control; there is no response-gain control.

### Duck depth
How far music drops while the assistant is talking over it. Music **keeps
playing** through a voice turn — it isn't paused — so the answer arrives
mixed over a quiet bed, and the bed comes back up when the answer ends.

Default **−18dB**. Less negative (−6, −10) leaves the music more present;
more negative (−25, −30) all but silences it for the length of the answer.
It's worth setting by ear in the room it plays in: the right depth depends
on what you listen to and how loud, and there is no value that is correct
everywhere. The response itself is never turned down, only the music under
it — so if an answer is hard to hear over music, this is the setting, not
the volume.

Requires firmware **v2.10.0 or newer**, which mixes the two audio streams on
the device itself. That is not an arbitrary requirement: the controller runs
about four seconds ahead of what you actually hear, so when you say the wake
word those four seconds of music are already sitting on the Echo, past
anything the controller could still change. Older firmware shows the slider
disabled and falls back to pausing the music for the turn and resuming
after.

### Volume
Volume **tracks what you actually use** and survives reboots: every change —
buttons, Home Assistant slider, wherever — is remembered by the controller
and restored when the device reconnects. Set it low in the evening and a
midnight power blip brings it back low.

There is no volume slider in this section. There used to be, and it was
misleading: the device only re-applies the stored level on the first config
push after it boots, so moving the slider did nothing until the device
restarted — and any real volume change overwrote it in the meantime. Volume
is remembered device state rather than a setting you dial in, so the current
level is now shown read-only on the **Status** tab. Change it from Home
Assistant or the device buttons.

It is also never inherited from the fleet, whatever the section's Fleet /
Device switch says — otherwise a device would come back at another room's
volume.

On the AFE/OpenSL path, the ten physical volume levels map to Android
`STREAM_MUSIC` indices **3 through 30**. Level 1 is index 3 and level 10 is
index 30. Home Assistant and Music Assistant commands snap every nonzero
volume to the same ten levels; `0` remains mute.

**The top of the range changed in 2.20.0.** EchoMuse used to drive the
codec's digital volume past the point where it can only clip — measured at
65% distortion three button presses above the midpoint, and 89% at the
maximum, with the output no longer getting any louder. Stock Alexa never
touches that control, which is why EchoMuse sounded worse than stock when
turned up. The range now stops at the codec's unity gain, so the loudest
setting is quieter than it was and everything below it is cleaner.

The percentage Home Assistant shows also moved: a device at the same
physical level reads a higher number than before, because the scale no
longer includes a stretch that only distorted. Nothing changed about how
loud it actually is. If you have an automation with a volume threshold in
it, check that threshold.

The physical buttons step about 4dB per press across the audible range,
rather than spending presses near the bottom of a scale where nothing is
audible — silencing the device is the mute button's job. The cyan ring
spans that same range, so a press always moves it.

Mute is remembered too, but by the device itself: a muted Dot stays muted
through reboots, power cuts, and firmware updates — red ring and all —
whether or not the controller is reachable.

---

## 02 — Wake word

How the device decides you said the magic word. All wake word and stopword
processing happens **on the Dot itself** — the controller never scores wake
audio and only arbitrates the turn requests the device asks for; see
**Wake word detection** below.

### Wake word model
Which word wakes it: Hey Jarvis, Alexa, Hey Mycroft, or Hey Rhasspy. These
are pre-trained recognisers — you're picking a word, not training anything.
Pick one that doesn't collide with words you say a lot (and if your
household still talks to real Alexas, don't pick Alexa).

Want your own word? Train a model with `oww_forge/` (see its README), then
use the **+ Custom model** tile to upload the `.onnx` — it's stored in the
controller's data volume, appears as a tile next to the stock words, and
takes effect immediately on selection. The `×` on an unselected custom tile
deletes it.

**If the device does its own wake word detection** (see *On-device wake
word*), it needs the recogniser on it before it can listen for that word.

All four stock words are installed during provisioning, so switching between
them is instant and needs no copy. A **custom** model is copied across when you
select it: the device carries on answering to its **current** wake word until
the new one arrives — usually a few seconds — and if the copy fails it stays on
the word it already has and the log says why. It is never left listening for a
word it does not have.

Devices provisioned before this was added get the missing stock recognisers
automatically the next time they connect.

Changing the wake word updates the controller's live device record. The HACS
integration reads that record on its normal update path, so the controller does
not tear down every Home Assistant entity merely to refresh a wake-word label.

### Arbitration window
With more than one Echo, saying the wake word in earshot of two of them
used to start two competing conversations. Now the **first device to hear
you answers immediately**, and any other device detecting the same word
within this window (default 700ms) quietly stands down.

There is **no latency cost**: the winner claims the turn on the spot rather
than waiting out the window, so a solo wake is exactly as fast as it was
before. The window only decides how long afterwards a second device counts
as "the same utterance". `0` disables it, and it never applies when only
one device is online.

An earlier version instead waited out the window and gave the turn to
whichever device heard you *best*. That was dropped: it taxed every wake by
~364ms even when nothing was competing, and field data showed the
signal-to-noise winner produced a *worse* transcript than the device that
simply heard you first.

### No-speech timeout
`noSpeechTimeoutMs`, default 5000. How long the Echo waits for you to say
something after a turn is granted — a wake word, a button tap, or a
follow-up question the assistant asked — before it ends the turn on its own
as *no speech*, the way an Alexa goes quiet again if you say the wake word
and nothing else.

The timer is **disarmed by the controller as soon as Home Assistant hears
you**: the HACS integration relays Home Assistant's own voice-activity
detection (`STT_VAD_START`) as a `speech-start` turn action, and any
transcript (partial or final) does the same. That relay is independent of
which speech-to-text engine the pipeline uses, so a slow engine that returns a
single final transcript six to eight seconds after you finish (a Gemini Live
bridge, for instance) no longer loses every turn to this timer — including
follow-up turns, which re-arm it. Raise it only if turns still end before
speech is detected; `0` turns the device-side timer off entirely (the
controller's own 30s ceiling on a turn still applies).

### Wake replay
`wakeReplayFrames`, default 25 (80ms mic frames, so about two seconds).
When the device detects the wake word it replays this many buffered frames
from *before* the activation into the turn, so the words you said in the same
breath as the wake word are not clipped. The tail of the wake phrase itself
rides along in that replay: a literal speech-to-text engine will transcribe
"hey jarvis turn on the light" rather than "turn on the light", and a
conversation agent may then answer the wake phrase. Set it to `0` to replay
nothing — the wake phrase stays out of the transcript, at the cost of
occasionally clipping a fast talker's first word.

### Sensitivity (Precise ↔ Eager)
The confidence bar the recogniser must clear.

- Toward **Precise**: fewer false wakes (it triggering off the TV), but it
  may ignore you sometimes.
- Toward **Eager**: catches you more reliably, but expect the occasional
  ghost activation.

**How to tune it**: **near-misses** are moments where the score came close
but didn't trigger. The device scores its own mic stream, so with **Save wake
captures** on it captures those near-misses and **Settings → Training** shows
them with their scores. If you're being ignored and near-misses are piling
up, move one step toward Eager. If it wakes up when nobody spoke, move toward
Precise.

### Barge-in
Lets the wake word **interrupt the assistant mid-turn** — say the wake word
while it is reading you a paragraph (or still thinking about your last
question) and it stops and listens. The paired Amazon AFE capture/playback
route handles the device-side audio processing needed while playback is live.

The **barge threshold** is the wake confidence required during playback, and
counter-intuitively it sits *lower* than the normal wake threshold. The
speaker is far louder at the microphones than you are, so your voice scores
lower over playback than it would in a quiet room — around 0.3 to 0.5
measured, against 0.5 for an ordinary wake.

**The default is 0.25, raised from 0.05.** The old value was chosen against
short replies and it did not survive long ones: asking for a story, the
assistant's own narration scored up to 0.18 and interrupted itself
mid-sentence. Continuous speech simply offers more chances to briefly sound
like a wake word. Two consecutive detections are now required as well, which
is what makes a single stray frame harmless.

If a response ever cuts itself off, raise this. If interrupting stops working,
lower it and inspect the device's AFE health/status first.

(During the silent *thinking* pause the normal wake sensitivity applies
instead — nothing is playing, so the low threshold is not needed there.)

**What happens after you interrupt.** The device stops talking and listens
straight away — say the wake word and your new command in one breath and it
hears both, without waiting for a second prompt. This only started working
properly in 2.20.1: before that the interrupt cut the response off but the
command that followed was never picked up, so you had to wait and ask again.

**Interrupting cannot be taken back.** If you say the wake word and then stay
quiet, the original answer is gone rather than resumed — Home Assistant has no
way to restart a reply it has already abandoned. The turn just ends quietly.

### Wake word detection
Wake word detection runs **entirely on the Dot**. The device scores its own
microphone stream with the selected wake model, and only when the score
crosses the threshold does it ask the controller for permission to start a
turn. No audio leaves the Dot until that grant — except opted-in training
captures, which you control per device. There is no controller-side detection
and no detector-location mode to choose: the controller never receives idle
microphone audio and never loads or runs a wake model.

**Why detection lives on the device.** The wake decision stops crossing your
network, so it is not delayed by a bad moment on the link. On a marginal
connection that is the difference between a Dot that responds promptly and
one that lags unpredictably.

Be clear about what it does **not** do:

- **It does not reduce network traffic to zero.** The audio still streams
  once a turn is granted, because the controller runs the rest of the turn.
- **It does not keep working without the controller.** The wake word is only
  the first step; the turn itself needs the controller for Home Assistant,
  the microphone stream and the spoken reply. A wake detected while the
  controller is down lights the ring and goes nowhere.

Three things the device-side detector needs:

- **Files installed on the Dot** that aren't part of the firmware —
  ONNX Runtime plus the wake-word models, about 15MB, placed in
  `/data/local/share/echomuse/oww`. They're deliberately not shipped in the
  firmware image, because that would double both the download and the space
  each of the two firmware slots takes. The dashboard installs them during
  provisioning and can repair them later from the device's Updates tab. Until
  they're there, wake detection is explicitly unavailable — the device says
  so rather than falling back to anything else.
- **About half a CPU core, permanently**, because the wake stream is always
  on. Measured on an Echo Dot Gen 2 that has capacity for it — the mic
  pipeline was unaffected across hours of use, including during music
  playback — but enable it on **one device at a time** and watch the
  **Resources** panel on the Status tab.
- **Recent firmware.** Each related control is disabled and says so on an
  Echo whose firmware cannot do it, rather than appearing to work.

The stopword ("stop" during a response) and barge-in (interrupting by saying
the wake word over playback) are scored the same way — on the device, against
the same AFE capture stream.

### Stop word (optional)
The **Stop word** section selects the local interruption model (`stopModel`)
that lets you say "stop" over a response, an announcement or a timer alert.
With a model selected it is mandatory protection: the controller will not
admit a wake, a button turn or a voice response until the Echo reports that
model ready, and the dashboard says so when it is missing.

It is **optional**. Select **Off** (an empty `stopModel`) and the controller
requires nothing of the device, arms nothing during responses, and reports
the stop word as off rather than as an error (`stopWordEnabled: false` on the
device status). Responses then end by themselves, by barge-in with the wake
word, or by the button.

The fleet default is the built-in `stop` model, which the published
controller image bundles at `/app/models/stopword/stop.onnx`. A controller
built from source without that file (or without a `stop.onnx` uploaded from
the Stop word section) has no classifier to install, so the default resolves
to **off** and the log says why on each device connect. Uploading a stop
model turns it back on; nothing else changes for a deployment that has the
model.

### Speech-to-text (Gemini 3.5 Transcribe, HACS)

STT is *not* Whisper or Cloud STT — it is the HACS integration’s own `stt.gemini_transcribe` platform (`hacs/custom_components/echo_voice_satellite/stt.py` `GeminiTranscribeEntity`). Per turn it opens one `google-genai` Live session (`gemini-3.5-transcribe-live`, `LiveConnectConfig` + `AudioTranscriptionConfig`) streaming the same 16 kHz mono `MIC_PCM` that the device already sends — no resampling, no shadow copy. `interim_input_transcription` → `transcript {is_final:false}` (logged at `DEBUG text=` on the controller, dropped by `em_support` in bundles), `input_transcription` → `SpeechResult` → `STT_END` → `is_final:true`. This is the only HA-level way to get partials.

Configure in **HA → Settings → Devices & Services → EchoMuse → Configure** (options flow):

- **Gemini API key** — long-lived `genai.Client(api_key=…)`, stored in the config entry (same trust as the controller `api_key`), `models.list()` validated at save → `invalid_gemini_key`. Blank = off (reversible, no `async_reload`).
- **Transcription mode** `VERBATIM` (default, literal) / `SMART` (disfluencies removed). `VERBATIM` is default because `SMART` changes which words the intent recognizer sees.
- **Custom vocabulary** — up to 1000 terms (`TextSelector(multiple=True)`, hard `1000`, soft “best up to 100”), e.g. entity/area names. Commas inside a term are preserved.
- **Language codes** — comma-separated BCP-47 (`_parse_language_codes`, `[]` → Gemini auto-detect 85+). This is *not* the pipeline’s `stt_language` (checked by `check_metadata` before we’re called, broad `~128`-code allowlist so a pipeline set to `en` doesn’t reject `es-ES`).

All four are `vol.Optional` and read fresh per `async_process_audio_stream` call — a mid-flight save takes effect on the *next* turn, the in-flight turn finishes with the old config. Requires `google-genai>=2.22.0` (`AudioTranscriptionConfig` with `language_codes`/`mode`/`custom_vocabulary`); older `1.59.0` installs fall back to empty `AudioTranscriptionConfig` (transcription still works, vocab ignored until upgraded).

Pick the provider per pipeline: **HA → Settings → Voice Assistants → your pipeline → STT engine → Gemini Transcribe** (opt-in, global per pipeline; no per-device switch). The controller stays provider-agnostic (`POST /api/turns/{id}/transcript {text,is_final}` only; `stt_latency_ms` gated on `is_final`).

## 03 — Microphones

Amazon AFE owns microphone-array selection, echo cancellation, and hardware
gain. EchoMuse receives its processed mono stream; there is no raw ALSA or
selectable microphone backend.

### Available controls

**AFE mic gain (dB)** — fixed digital gain applied after AFE processing and
before VAD, wake-word scoring, recordings, and transmission to the controller.
Default **0dB**. Raise it only when recordings confirm speech is too quiet;
saturated samples are counted in device diagnostics.

Echo cancellation and beam selection are mandatory Amazon AFE processing, not
EchoMuse settings. Barge-in always uses that AFE capture path.

**Save utterances** — keeps the audio of recent voice turns so you can
*listen* to what was sent for transcription. The **Activity** tab then shows
a ▶ (play here) and a ⤓ (download the WAV) on every turn that has a
recording.

What's saved is the audio **exactly as speech-to-text received it**. When a
transcript comes back wrong, the recording is the audio the recogniser actually
heard.

This is the honest way to answer "is my microphone any good?". Without it
you're guessing from a garbled transcript, which can't tell you whether the
room was noisy or the gain was too low. Thirty seconds of listening usually
settles it — and lets you compare the same phrase after changing **AFE mic
gain**.

**Off by default, and worth thinking about before switching on.** This is the
only setting that stores recognisable speech on the controller. What's kept:
the **last 10 turns per device**, as plain WAV files in the controller's data
folder, each overwritten as newer ones arrive. Only the audio sent for
recognition is saved — never the always-on wake-word listening, which is
discarded continuously and never written anywhere.

Turning the setting back off stops new recordings immediately, but **leaves
the ones already saved where they are** — deliberately, so that switching off
doesn't destroy samples you were part-way through comparing. They stay until
newer recordings push them out (which needs the setting back on) or you
delete the device, which removes its recordings too. To clear them out sooner,
delete the files from the controller's `data/recordings/` folder.

A turn recorded a while ago may show no buttons — that just means its
recording has aged past the last 10 and the turn history has outlived it.

---

## 04 — Ring

The colours the LED ring uses during conversations. Scenes apply
instantly and can differ per device. On current firmware (v2.9+) the
device animates the ring itself — the controller sends one "play this
animation" instruction per state change, so the spinner stays perfectly
smooth regardless of WiFi or controller load, and while a response is
speaking the ring **throbs in time with the audio** (brightness follows
the actual level coming out of the speaker). If the controller ever
vanishes mid-conversation the ring times itself out rather than spinning
forever. Older firmware falls back to controller-rendered frames.

- **Standard** — the classic green.
- **Airy** — a pale, calm sky blue.
- **Malevolent** — deep crimson listening ring with an ember spinner.
- **Pride** — a rotating rainbow.
- **Custom** — pick your own **Listening** (solid ring while recording) and
  **Thinking** (spinner while processing) colours.

Two things never change, in every scene: the **red mute ring** (red always
means the microphones are off — it's a privacy indicator, not decoration)
and the cyan volume arc. The directional "which mic is listening" highlight
also adapts automatically: it brightens the scene's ring colour rather than
painting green.

The volume arc holds the ring for about two seconds so a turn animation
can't wipe it the instant it appears — but **pressing the action button
cancels it immediately**, so adjusting the volume and then talking to the
device still shows you the listening ring straight away.

### Timer countdown

When the device is otherwise idle, a running timer appears as a partial ring:
the lit portion is its remaining time, in a colour derived from your selected
scene. If several timers are running, the first one you started is the one
shown. Pausing it holds the segment still; resuming it makes it continue to
shrink. Conversations, link status, mute, and the physical cyan volume arc
take the ring while they are active. When the timer expires, its amber alarm
pulse replaces the countdown.

This uses the same local animation support as the conversation ring. Firmware
that predates the `countdown` pattern simply leaves the resting ring dark; the
timer and its alarm still work normally.

### How a turn ends
The ring tells you *why* a conversation stopped, using rhythm rather than
colour (red, orange and cyan already mean mute, no-controller and volume):

- **One slow throb** — the device was listening and heard nothing.
- **A few quick blinks** — something went wrong (Home Assistant errored, or
  no speech came back).
- **Ring simply goes out** — normal end, or you cancelled it yourself.

The ring also now clears when the audio *actually* finishes, rather than
when the controller estimates it should have. On a slow WiFi link the old
estimate could clear the ring several seconds before the Dot had stopped
talking.

### Meter response (Advanced)
While a response plays the ring throbs with the live speaker level. The
**Advanced** panel here shapes how hard it throbs — the device renders it
locally, so changes apply on the next response with no restart:

- **Decay** — how fast it falls. Higher tracks individual syllables; lower
  reads as a slow swell.
- **Attack** — how fast it rises on a peak.
- **Gamma** — contrast. Higher makes the swing more visible.
- **Floor** — brightness during silence. `0` goes fully dark between words.
- **Reference** — the speaker level mapped to full brightness. Lower is more
  sensitive.
- **Curve** — below `1` lifts quiet consonants into view.

These are taste settings, which is exactly why they're adjustable here
rather than baked into firmware. The defaults are tuned for speech; if the
ring looks too static, raise **Decay** and **Gamma** first.

## 05 — Advanced

Everything in this section affects **only button-press conversations**
(tapping the action button to talk without a wake word — a *hold* is a
separate gesture that fires an event in Home Assistant instead). Wake-word
conversations ignore all of it — they're managed by Home Assistant's own
speech detection.

While the mic is muted a tap does nothing, but a hold still fires its event:
the mute silences speech, not the button.

### Make the tap an event instead

**Tap fires an event** (`buttonSingleTapEvent`) — turns a tap into a Home
Assistant event rather than the start of a conversation, so you can bind it to
anything you like. With it on, the device no longer starts a voice turn from
the button at all; the wake word is untouched, and a hold still fires `long`.
A tap fires while muted too, for the same reason a hold does — it's an event,
not speech.

Needs firmware v2.10.0 or newer. On older firmware the toggle is disabled and
says so.

**Bind destructive automations to the hold, not the tap.** The button has no
authentication, and a speaker sitting on a counter is a great deal easier to
tap by accident than to hold for three quarters of a second.

**Multi-tap window** (`buttonMultiTapMs`) — set it above zero and taps are
grouped into `single`, `double` or `triple`. The cost is that *every* tap is
delayed by this window, because a tap can only be called single once no
second one follows.

**Use 350ms.** Below about 300ms it fights both human timing — double taps
land roughly 150–400ms apart — and network jitter, because the gap is
currently measured when the taps reach the controller rather than on the
device. On a busy or distant device you may need more. Zero disables
grouping, and a tap fires `single` immediately.

### Speech gate

Decides when a button-press utterance starts and stops:

- **Threshold** — how loud counts as "speech" in the processed AFE stream.
  AFE mic gain is accounted for internally, so changing it does not require
  retuning this threshold. The default 0.001
  was validated by measurement; raise slightly (0.003–0.005) only in
  genuinely noisy rooms.
- **Speech gate (ms)** — how much continuous speech opens the gate. Higher =
  ignores brief noises, but clips fast talkers.
- **Silence gate (ms)** — how much silence ends your turn. Higher = you can
  pause mid-sentence without being cut off; lower = snappier responses. 900ms
  default; raise to ~1200 if you get cut off mid-thought.

Note (v2.9.4): these two timings now behave exactly as configured. Older
firmware quietly applied them ~5× longer than the number said (a counting
bug against the mic's real batch size), so button-press turns used to hang
on for a few seconds of silence before ending — if turns feel snappier
after updating, that's why, and if a slow talker now gets clipped, raise
the silence gate.

---

## 06 — Bluetooth

**Bluetooth proxy** — turns the Dot into a Home Assistant Bluetooth proxy.
The device passively listens for Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements
(presence beacons, BLE temperature/humidity sensors, phones and watches for
room-presence systems like Bermuda) and forwards them to Home Assistant.

The EchoMuse HACS integration forwards enabled scanner data to Home Assistant's
Bluetooth remote-scanner path. It is not a separate ESPHome device; its
availability follows the EchoMuse device and controller connection.

Two things to know before enabling:

- Enabling **permanently switches the Dot's Bluetooth chip away from
  Android's stack** (it survives reboots). Nothing EchoMuse uses needs
  Android Bluetooth — but stock-style Bluetooth speaker pairing stops being
  possible on that device.
- The proxy is **receive-only** (passive scanning). Devices that need an
  active connection to read data (some smart locks, older BLE devices)
  aren't supported — advert-based sensors and presence tracking are.

Diagnostics live on the device's **Status tab** (Bluetooth proxy panel):
scanner state, advertisements seen, nearby device count, and whether Home
Assistant is connected and receiving.

## WiFi (device page → Config tab, top section)

Move a device to a different WiFi network without touching ADB. The section
at the top of the Config tab shows the current network, signal, and IP, lets
you scan for visible networks, and switches with a confirmation step.

The switch is designed to be **unbrickable**: the device applies the change
itself and must pass three checks — join the network, get an IP, and
**reconnect to this controller** — before the change is kept. Fail any of
them (wrong passphrase, DHCP trouble, or a network that works but can't
reach the controller, like an isolated guest VLAN) and it automatically
restores the previous network and tells you why. Even a power cut
mid-switch recovers: an unconfirmed change is rolled back on boot. Allow
about two minutes for the device to drop off and come back.

## Controller settings (the `.env` file)

These are set once, on the server, and need a controller restart to change:

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| `SERVER_IP` | The controller computer's LAN IP — what devices are told to connect to. Leave it empty to detect it from this host; the controller refuses to start rather than advertise an address it had to guess at, and warns if the detected one looks like a container bridge. |
| `DEVICE_APPROVAL` | `strict` (you approve every new device — recommended) or `auto`. |
| `MUSIC_ASSISTANT_URL` | Music Assistant Sendspin endpoint pushed to native Echo devices. This is the **deployment default only**: the value in the dashboard's Settings page (`music_assistant_url`, stored in the controller database) takes precedence once it has been saved there, and is what devices are actually sent from then on — change it there, not in `.env`, after first setup. |
| `SERVER_TLS_PORT` | Encrypted device link (wss) port — default 8770, `0` disables. Devices switch to it automatically once they hold pushed credentials (wizard install, or the **Secure link** button on the device Status tab). |
| `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS` | Set to `1` **only after every device shows "wss (TLS)"** on its Status tab — from then on the controller rejects unencrypted or tokenless device connections. |
| `EM_EXTRA_CA_CERT` | Path to a PEM CA certificate to trust — only needed if Home Assistant is served over HTTPS with your own internal certificate authority. See below. |

See `.env.example` for the complete list with comments.

### Encrypted device link

The controller generates its own certificate authority on first start
(stored in `tls/` next to the database) and listens for encrypted device
connections alongside the plain ones. Each device gets two credentials —
the CA certificate and a private token — installed automatically by the
provisioning wizard, or pushed to an existing device with the **Secure
link** button on its Status tab. A device with credentials connects
encrypted from its next reconnect; the Status tab's **Link** row shows
which mode each device is using. Once the whole fleet shows `wss (TLS)`,
set `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS=1` to lock out unencrypted connections entirely.

### Home Assistant behind a private certificate authority

If media is served over HTTPS with a certificate from your own internal CA,
EchoMuse refuses it rather than accepting an unverified peer. Give the
controller that CA so verified playback can proceed.

Give EchoMuse the CA:

- **Add-on** — put the CA certificate (PEM format) in Home Assistant's `ssl`
  folder, then set the **Private CA certificate** option to
  `/ssl/<filename>`. The add-on reads that folder read-only.
- **Container** — mount the certificate and set `EM_EXTRA_CA_CERT` to its path
  *inside* the container:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - /path/to/internal-ca.crt:/certs/internal-ca.crt:ro
  environment:
    - EM_EXTRA_CA_CERT=/certs/internal-ca.crt
  ```

It must be a **PEM** file — the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` kind. If yours is
DER, convert it first:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform der -in ca.der -out ca.crt
```

If the file is missing, unreadable or not PEM, the controller **refuses to
start and says which**, rather than running with HTTPS media playback that
fails certificate verification.

**Media playback verifies too.** The media player fetches its streams —
Music Assistant, radio, anything handed to `play_media` — through ffmpeg,
which used to accept *any* certificate on HTTPS URLs (an ffmpeg build
default nobody would have chosen). Media URLs are now verified like every
other fetch. A stream served over HTTPS with a private CA needs the same
setting as above; when a stream is refused, the log says so and points
here.

## What leaves your network

EchoMuse has **no telemetry**. There is no usage reporting, no analytics, no
crash reporting and no install counter. Nothing reports which features you
use, how many devices you have, or that you installed it at all. This is a
deliberate decision rather than an omission: the project exists to take a
cloud voice assistant off your network, and quietly adding a ping home would
undo the reason to run it.

A consequence worth stating plainly: **nobody, including the maintainers, can
tell how many people use EchoMuse.** Adoption is guessed at from GitHub stars
and release download counts, which is the trade being made.

### The one outbound connection

The controller contacts `api.github.com` once an hour to ask what the newest
release is, so the dashboard can tell you an update is available and show its
notes. When you choose to update a device, the firmware binary is downloaded
from `github.com` at that moment.

That is the whole of it. The request carries no identifiers — it is an
ordinary unauthenticated API call — but like any request it does reveal your
public IP to GitHub, the same exposure as a `git clone` or opening the repo
in a browser.

Set `update_check_interval` (seconds, default `3600`) in the system config to
change how often it runs. A long interval, say `86400`, reduces it to once a
day, and `0` turns it off entirely — the controller then makes no outbound
connection at all, and the dashboard shows whatever it last knew about
releases rather than nothing.

Re-enabling takes effect without a restart. Turning it off does not disable
the **Check now** button on the Updates tab: that is a deliberate request, so
it still asks GitHub when you press it.

> **Before controller 2.21.0, `0` did the opposite** — it removed the pause
> between checks instead of stopping them, so the controller polled
> continuously until GitHub rate-limited it. If you set it to `0` on an
> earlier version and left it there, updating fixes it; there is nothing to
> undo.

### What never leaves

- **Voice audio and transcripts.** Mic audio goes from the device to your
  controller and on to your Home Assistant, over your LAN. What happens next
  is whatever your Assist pipeline does — if you have configured HA to use a
  cloud speech-to-text service, HA sends it there. EchoMuse itself sends it
  nowhere but HA.
- **Saved utterance recordings** (`saveUtterances`, off by default) — written
  to disk beside the database and never uploaded. Playing or downloading them
  is **admin-only**, as is seeing the transcript text of a turn: on the Home
  Assistant add-on every household user can reach the dashboard, so read-only
  accounts get turn timings, scores and outcomes without the speech. Enforced
  on the server, not just hidden in the page.
- **Device serials, WiFi credentials, network names and your fleet's
  configuration.** These live only in the controller's database.
- **Support bundles** are built only when you ask for one, and sharing the
  file is your decision. They deliberately exclude speech, transcripts,
  network names and account names — see
  [support-bundle.md](support-bundle.md).
