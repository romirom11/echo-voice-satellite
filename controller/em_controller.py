EchoMuse Controller
===================

WebSocket server. Echo Dot devices connect via mDNS discovery.

mDNS advertisement is handled internally — no separate container required.

Architecture:
- Advertise _emcontroller._tcp on SERVER_PORT (zeroconf, host network)
- Devices open THREE connections:
    /control — JSON control plane (buttons, LEDs, mic_start/stop, ping,
                                   register, config, log, pending)
    /data    — binary data plane (mic PCM frames in, speaker PCM frames out)
    /shell   — raw binary stdin/stdout (demand-opened for shell sessions
                                        and OTA binary transfer)
- HTTP API and dashboard SPA served by aiohttp on API_PORT

Device WebSocket protocol:
  /control — Device → Server:
    {"type": "register", "device_id": "G0K0XXXXXXXX", "ip": "...",
     "version": "v2.0.1", "capabilities": [...]}
    {"type": "button", "clickType": 138, "down": false}
    {"type": "log", "level": "info", "message": "..."}
    {"type": "playback_stats", "periods": 123, "underruns": 0}
    {"type": "pong"}

  /control — Server → Device:
    {"type": "ack",     "device_id": "..."}
    {"type": "pending"}
    {"type": "config",  "adcDigitalGain": 100, ...}
    {"type": "leds",    "leds": [...]}
    {"type": "mic_start"}
    {"type": "mic_stop"}
    {"type": "ping"}

  /data — Device → Server:
    <binary> [0x01][seq_hi][seq_lo][PCM mono S16_LE 2560 bytes]

  /data — Server → Device:
    <binary> [0x02][PCM mono S16_LE 48kHz — 4096 bytes per period]
    <binary> [0x03] end of audio stream

  /shell — bidirectional raw binary (demand-opened by device on
           receipt of shell_open control message — not yet implemented
           in this revision; shell connections come inbound from the
           Go binary to the controller's /shell/{device_id} path)

          the DEVICE to report the moment it starts, which no released firmware

        mid-send: the flag assignment is synchronous and always happens, and a

    Device-link auth gate, applied to all three WS planes once the
    device_id is known.

    Rules (rollout-safe by construction):
      - a presented token that MISMATCHES a stored one always rejects;
      - a stored token with NO token presented is allowed unless
        REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS — the DB row is minted before the files land
        on the device, and rejecting in that window would cut off the
        shell plane that the credential push itself rides on;
      - a presented token for a device with NOTHING on record is ignored,
        not rejected (see below);
      - REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS=1 requires TLS + a matching token, full stop.

    That third rule used to be a rejection, and it made deleting a device a
    one-way door. Delete removes the row, the token is a column on it, and the
    device re-reads its credential file on every dial — so it presented a token
    nothing recognised and was refused on all three planes, INCLUDING the shell
    plane the controller would otherwise push fresh credentials over. The
    device retried forever behind a pulsing orange ring, and the dashboard had
    nothing to show because as far as it was concerned the device did not
    exist.

    Rejecting there also never bought anything. The rule immediately above
    admits a connection presenting no token at all, so an unrecognised token
    was being treated as worse than none while anyone could simply omit the
    header. A device with a stale credential now comes back as pending and
    waits for approval, which is the decision a human should be making anyway.

    `REQUIRE_DEVICE_TLS=1` installs are unaffected: the last rule still
    demands a token that matches a stored one, so a deleted device is refused
    there regardless and re-provisioning over USB stays the intended path.
