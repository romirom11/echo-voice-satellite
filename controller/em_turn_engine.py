"""HA-facing voice turn engine.

The controller owns device capture and playback. This module owns the live
turn rendezvous with the HACS integration: REST/event lifecycle plus one
bidirectional audio WebSocket per turn. See docs/design/full-duplex-plan.md for the full
design and CLAUDE.md's "Voice backend" section for how this fits with
`em_controller.py` and the HACS integration under `hacs/`.

Known gaps, deliberately not closed by the Phase 4 cutover (mechanical
repoint + delete of the ESPHome-impersonation backend) — each is a real,
scoped follow-up rather than a silent omission:

- **Barge-in is device-originated.** A local device wake request is granted
  against the active turn and emits `turn.cancel` to HACS before the
  interrupting turn starts.
- **No SNR-relative no-speech backstop via `em_turnclock`.** The old
  ESPHome-mode turn used `em_turnclock` to end a turn against each room's
  measured noise floor rather than a fixed timer; this module does not yet
  call it, so no-speech timing here is less room-adaptive than the backend it
  replaced. It is bounded, though (`ENDPOINT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_S` on `_run_turn`'s
  `turn.endpoint.wait()`) — see that constant's comment for why an unbounded
  version of this same gap once hung a device's voice_lock for 3+ hours.
- **No `pending_playback_stats` fold-in for a turn whose DB row doesn't exist
  yet.** If a device's `playback_stats` report for a turn arrives before
  `db.create_turn`'s row exists (a narrow ordering window), it is not folded
  into that turn's persisted stats.
- **No on-device shadow-wake correlation via `last_wake_mono`.** The shadow
  device wake-detector reporting is not yet wired to turns
  created here, so an on-device threshold crossing is not correlated against
  turns run through this engine the way it was under the old backend.

# wait was unbounded: a marginal wake (score 0.403 against a 0.400 threshold,
# 2026-08-19 — effectively noise) started a turn where neither signal ever
# arrived, and _run_turn's `await turn.endpoint.wait()` hung for 3+ hours,
# holding device.voice_lock the entire time — wake word detection pauses for
# the duration of a locked turn, so the device looked permanently "stuck
# listening" with no way to recover short of a controller restart.

# This is deliberately the narrow fix, not the full em_turnclock port this
# module's docstring above still calls out as a gap: em_turnclock's two-clock

# analysed for real speech against the room's noise floor, which _send_mic
# does not do — it only forwards frames. A single generous ceiling instead
# guarantees the turn always resolves, reusing the exact "audio_timeout"
# outcome and cleanup path a socket that never opens already produces
# (trigger_voice_turn's and _finish_created_turn's existing
# `except asyncio.TimeoutError` handlers), rather than adding a new one.
# 30s comfortably covers a long utterance plus VAD-close plus STT round trip
